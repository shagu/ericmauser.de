<h1>pfUI</h1>

<p><strong>This AddOn is no longer under active development. Bugfixes will still be made and pull-requests will be processed. However, feature-requests will no longer being worked on.</strong></p>

<p>An AddOn for World of Warcraft: Vanilla (1.12.1) and The Burning Crusade (2.4.3), which aims to be a full replacement for the original interface. The design is inspired by several screenshots I've seen from TukUI, ElvUI and others. This addon delivers modern features and a minimalistic style that's easy to use right from the start. It is entirely written from scratch without any inclusion of third-party addons or libraries.</p>

<p>This is <strong>not</strong> an addon-pack like <a href="http://shagu.org/ShaguUI/">ShaguUI</a>, however, there is support for external addons like MobHealth3, DPSMate and others, but they will never be shipped within the package.</p>

<p><strong>Please do not re-upload or distribute outdated versions of this project. However, you are more than welcome to fork or link to the official github page.</strong></p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>What does "pfUI" stand for?</strong> <br/>
The term "<em>pfui!</em>" is german and simply stands for "<em>pooh!</em>", because I'm not a
big fan of creating configuration UI's, especially not via the Wow-API
(you might have noticed that in ShaguUI).</p>

<p>~~<strong>Is there a discord channel?</strong>~~ <br/>
~~Yes there is one: <a href="https://discord.gg/QTRKanu">Discord Invite</a>~~</p>

<p><strong>How can I donate?</strong> <br/>
You can't. I'm doing this for fun. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>How do I report a Bug?</strong> <br/>
Please provide as much information as possible in the <a href="https://github.com/shagu/pfUI/issues">Bugtracker</a>.
If there is an error message, provide the full content of it. Just telling that "there is an error" won't help any of us.
Please consider adding additional information such as: since when did you got the error,
does it still happen using a clean configuration, what other addons are loaded and which version you're running.
When playing with a non-english client, the language might be relevant too. If possible, explain how people can reproduce the issue.</p>

<p><strong>How can I contribute?</strong> <br/>
Report Errors, Issues and Feature Requests in the <a href="https://github.com/shagu/pfUI/issues">Bugtracker</a>.
Please make sure to have the latest version installed and check for conflicting addons beforehand.</p>

<p><strong>I have bad performance, what can I do?</strong> <br/>
There's only one known performance issue: that is while using "Frame Shadows". Make sure to disable those
in the pfUI settings (Settings -> Appearance -> Enable Frame Shadows). If you still have a low performance,
it's most likely a combination with another addon. Disable all AddOns but pfUI and then enable one-by-one,
till the performance problem occurs again. Make sure to report the identified AddOn and what you did to reproduce
via the <a href="https://github.com/shagu/pfUI/issues">Bugtracker</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Where is the happiness indicator for pets?</strong> <br/>
The pet happiness is shown as the color of your pet's frame. Depending on your skin, this can either be the text or the background color of your pet's healthbar:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Green = Happy</li>
    <li>Yellow = Content</li>
    <li>Red = Unhappy</li>
</ul>

<p>Since version 4.0.7 there is also an additional icon that can be enabled from the pet unit frame options.</p>

<p><strong>Can I use Clique with pfUI?</strong> <br/>
This addon already includes support for clickcasting. If you still want to make use of clique, all pfUI's unitframes are already compatible to Clique-TBC. For Vanilla, a pfUI compatible version can be found <a href="https://github.com/shagu/Clique/archive/master.zip">Here</a>. If you want to keep your current version of Clique, you'll have to apply this <a href="https://github.com/shagu/Clique/commit/a5ee56c3f803afbdda07bae9cd330e0d4a75d75a">Patch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Where is the Experience Bar?</strong> <br/>
The experience bar shows up on mouseover and whenever you gain experience, next to left chatframe by default. There's also an option to make it stay visible all the time.</p>

<p><strong>How do I show the Damage- and Threatmeter Dock?</strong> <br/>
If you enabled the "dock"-feature for your external (third-party) meters such as DPSMate or KTM, then you'll be able to toggle between them and the Right Chat by clicking on the ">" symbol on the bottom-right panel.</p>

<p><strong>Why is my chat always resetting to only 3 lines of text?</strong> <br/>
You need to disable the "Simple Chat" in blizzards interface settings (Advanced Options). Then relog and reset/run the firstrun wizard again.</p>

<p><strong>How can I enable mouseover cast?</strong> <br/>
On Vanilla, create a macro with "/pfcast SPELLNAME". If you also want to see the cooldown, You might want to add "/run if nil then CastSpellByName("SPELLNAME") end" on top of the macro. For The Burning Crusade, just use the regular mouseover macros.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be pfUI for Activision's "Classic" remakes?</strong> <br/>
No, it would require an entire rewrite of the AddOn since the game is now a different one. The AddOn-API has evolved during the last 15 years and the new "Classic" versions are based on a current retail gameclient. I don't plan to play any of those new versions, so I won't be porting any of my addons to it.</p>

<p><strong>Everything from scratch?! Are you insane?</strong> <br/>
Most probably, yes.</p>
