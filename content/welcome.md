## Welcome
My name is Eric and I'm a software developer. I started using linux in the late 90's and since became a linux- and opensource enthusiast. I have a passion for retro games, for which I write scripts, mods and addons. I also enjoy doing website development and graphic design, even without being good at it.

I work as an embedded software engineer in Stuttgart (Germany) where I create yocto-based embedded linux distributions. I monitor and patch vulnerabilities to keep things secure, and port software to different hardware plattforms. And of course, I do a lot of shell scripting and software automation.

Now I'd like to welcome you to my website. It is mainly a collection of random notes and snippets of documentation. It might not contain any useful information for you. Nevertheless, I decided to publish it because one day it might be interesting for someone... You never know.
