# RG350M Handheld Linux Gaming Console

    CPU: JZ4770 1GHz MIPS (Single Core)
    RAM: 512MB RAM (DDR2)
    Display: 3.5 Inch 640x480 (IPS)
    Storage: 2 SD-Card slots
    Battery : Li-polymer 2500mAh battery

The RG350M is a portable gaming console based on the [OpenDingux](https://github.com/retrogamehandheld/OpenDingux/wiki) project.
The devices has 2 SD-Card slots where one is for the root filesystem and the other for external data like roms or videos.
It has by default full root access via SSH (over USB). Each document and shop states it being a dual core processor, but I've been
only able to see one core in "htop" and also `cat /proc/cpuinfo` only lists one.
